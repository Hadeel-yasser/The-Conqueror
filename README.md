# The-Conqueror
In this turn-based single-player game, the player can start building his army to conquer the available cities and be announced as a winner in this game.

This game was developed using Java and the MVC design pattern was applied during the development of this game. The game is turn-based and on each turn, the player is allowed only a certain amount of moves they can do before they would need to end their turn to reset these moves. The player can build buildings and upgrade them to equip the army with the needed health and power. When the player manages to conquer all the available cities by fighting the defending army of these cities only then could they be announced as victorious.
